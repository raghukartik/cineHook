# 🍿 cineHook
> *Your personal movie recommendation & watchlist app*

**cineHook** is a smart React-based movie watchlist and recommendation app. It not only lets you search movies, rate them out of 10, and build your personal **Watched List**, but also **recommends movies tailored to your taste** using a custom-built recommendation API. Your data is stored locally in your browser with **Local Storage**, so it stays intact even after refreshing or reopening the app.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Search input triggers an API call to OMDb API.
2. Search results are shown in real time.
3. Clicking a movie lets you:
   - View details
   - Rate it out of 10
   - Add to your **Watched List**
4. Watched list is stored in `localStorage` and retrieved on app load.
5. **Recommendations** are generated by analyzing your watched list and fetching similar movies via a custom API.

## 🔁 Recommendation System

cineHook includes a smart recommendation system that suggests movies based on your watched history. It uses a custom-built API developed by [VoyagerX21](https://github.com/VoyagerX21/server-movierecom-cinehook), which processes your watched list and returns tailored movie suggestions.

### 👇 How it works:

- The titles from your watched list are sent to the recommendation API.
- The API analyzes movie genres, ratings, and similarities.
- It returns a list of recommended movies you might enjoy next.
- These are then displayed in a dedicated **Recommendations** section in the app.
